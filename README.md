# About Me
I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering and Design. My areas of interest include low level software, computer graphics, embedded systems, game design, and audio and signal processing. I plan on graduating in 2025 and entering the software industry. Currently, I am seeking internships for the Summer of 2023.  
    
  
# Background
After high school, I got a job in an auto shop, where in three years I worked my way up from cleaning floors, to doing oil changes, to eventually performing complex jobs including top-end engine rebuilds, electrical diagnosis, and suspension repair. During these years I discovered a love of engineering that inspired to pursue my education. I enrolled at Texas State University, where I held a 4.0 GPA before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin.  

Throughout my studies, my technical background from working in the auto shop has proven to be a significant advantage. My extended technical experience gives context to much of my applied studies, and affords me a unique perspective. My matured diagnostic skills help me to quickly debug software and track down electrical issues. Being an auto technician is nothing if not problem solving: and these skills and experiences have absolutely made me a better student and prospective engineer.

At the end of Intro to Embedded Systems at UT, the class puts everything from the semester together into a handheld game design competition. The system is driven by a TM4C microcontroller, and interfaces with a 128x160 TFT LCD display, a 6-bit DAC, a joystick & a slidepot, 4 buttons and 6 LEDs through a custom PCB that I designed. The gameplay is sort of "bullet hell" style, with 5 levels, a boss fight, and upgrades available for purchase throughout with coins earned from downing enemies. The game was written in one week in a combination of C and C++.

# Extra-Cirricular Projects
These are some projects I have worked on on my own time for research, learning, fun, to solve a problem, or all of the above.
## OpenGL Game Engine

![OpenGL Shader Code](/docs/assets/images/shader_code_eg.png)
For 8 weeks in the Summer of 2022 I began researching computer graphics, OpenGL and GPU programming in order to create a game from scratch. After building code capable of doing basics such as opening a window, reading/compiling/uploading shaders, creating VAOs on the GPU & rendering, I began designing an engine for an interactive game. This project is still a work in progress, and not a complete game. However, when launched, the user can control a pixart character in top down view, where they can walk, aim, sprint, zoom in & out, and collide with nearby objects.

## Grocery List Maker

![grocery list maker home screen](/docs/assets/images/grocery-list-maker.png)
Out of necessity, I created a tool that keeps a list of recipes and meals you like, and uses it to create you a grocery list by randomly selecting you a desired number of recipes or snacks based on your input. For example, you can tell it you need 7 meals for the week, only 3 of which you want to have to cook. It will look through your recipe list and select you some options at random, from which you can add/remove entries, confirm, and then the program will save you a grocery list in an external file.   
Your recipies and ingredients are kept in an external file and enumerated using a unique yet fairly natural syntax. The program can also simply act as a recipe book, letting you search and see information about all of your recipes.
