## About Me
I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering and Design. My areas of interest include low level software, computer graphics, embedded systems, game design, and audio and signal processing. I plan on graduating in 2025 and entering the software industry. Currently, I am seeking internships for the Summer of 2023.  
  
## Background
After high school, I got a job in an auto shop, where in three years I worked my way up from cleaning floors, to doing oil changes, to eventually performing complex jobs including top-end engine rebuilds, electrical diagnosis, and suspension repair. During these years I discovered a love of engineering that inspired to pursue my education. I enrolled at Texas State University, where I held a 4.0 GPA before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin.

Throughout my studies, my technical background from working in the auto shop has proven to be a significant advantage. My extended technical experience gives context to much of my applied studies, and affords me a unique perspective. My matured diagnostic skills help me to quickly debug software and track down electrical issues. Being an auto technician is nothing if not problem solving: and these skills and experiences have absolutely made me a better student and prospective engineer.  

## Projects *(Extra-Cirricular)*
I have a genuine passion for creating that extends outside of class and career. Below are some of my extra-cirricular projects.
