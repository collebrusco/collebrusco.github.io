# About Me
I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering and Design. My areas of interest include low level software, computer graphics, embedded systems, game design, and audio and signal processing. I plan on graduating in 2025 and entering the software industry. Currently, I am seeking internships for the Summer of 2023.  
  
# Background
After high school, I got a job in an auto shop, where in three years I worked my way up from cleaning floors, to doing oil changes, to eventually performing complex jobs including top-end engine rebuilds, electrical diagnosis, and suspension repair. During these years I discovered a love of engineering that inspired to pursue my education. I enrolled at Texas State University, where I held a 4.0 GPA before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin.  

Throughout my studies, my technical background from working in the auto shop has proven to be a significant advantage. My extended technical experience gives context to much of my applied studies, and affords me a unique perspective. My matured diagnostic skills help me to quickly debug software and track down electrical issues. Being an auto technician is nothing if not problem solving: and these skills and experiences have absolutely made me a better student and prospective engineer.

# Extra-Cirricular Projects
I have a genuine passion for creating that extends outside of class and career. These are some of my extra-cirricular projects. These were NOT done for school or work, but entirely on my own time.
## OpenGL Game Engine
### [Github Repo](https://github.com/collebrusco/opengl-game-engine) &nbsp;|&nbsp; [Youtube Demo]()   
For 8 weeks in the Summer of 2022 I began extensive research into computer graphics, OpenGL and GPU programming in order to work on creating a game from scratch. After building a codebase capable of doing basics such as opening a window, reading/compiling/uploading shaders, and creating and uploading VAOs to the GPU, I began designing an engine for an interactive game. This project is still a work in progress, and not a complete game. However, when launched, the user can control a pixart character in top down view, where they can walk, aim, sprint, zoom in & out, and collide with nearby objects.
